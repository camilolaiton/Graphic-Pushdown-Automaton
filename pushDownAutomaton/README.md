# Graphic Pushdown Automaton
This project is based on Turing machines and is made with Python and Graphviz. 
In this project, you can see the step by step functionality of a Turing machine graphically. It's for educational purposes. If you have any questions, just let me know.

## Getting started
> When I have more time, I'll put them here so you won't have any problems running it on your local machine.
